    <span>[2025-06-08 Sun]</span> By doing this website (hello, this is the first post) I realized i wanted a way to easily read and modify photo metadata from CL as to easily publish photos to <a href="{{ url_for('photos') }}">my "portfolio"</a> easily and make it easy to aumatically upload them.

    Since I really want to make this and the options I have found are not being activelly maintained I will make my own. There is also a point to remake this webpage in some language cooler than regular old python but for now it will stay this way to my dismay (not really i dont wanna mess with html serving, it's annoying).
